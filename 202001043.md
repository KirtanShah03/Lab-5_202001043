**Tool : Prospector**
- I used Prospector to find error of the code of [english_passwords.py](https://github.com/jcrocholl/nicerpasswords/blob/master/english_passwords.py). 

- The errors are as shown below, <br/>

**Analysis of Errors :**
<br/><br/>
**● Error for Unused variables<br/>**
- This type of errors can be taken into account as warnings but for better practice we can solve this type of errors by trying to avoid declaring those type of  variables.

> Line: 101<br />
>    pylint: unused-variable / Unused variable 'd' (col 8)<br />

>     for d in range(digits):


> Line: 141<br />
>    pylint: unused-variable / Unused variable 'count' (col 8)<br />

>        count, group1, group2 = triple


> Line: 216<br />
>    pylint: unused-variable / Unused variable 'row' (col 12)<br />

>         for row in range(20):


> Line: 217<br />
>    pylint: unused-variable / Unused variable 'column' (col 16)<br />

>             for column in range(4):

<br/><br/>

**● Use 'with' command to open files**
- We need to close that file manually after required task is done. If we use 'with' here then resource de-allocation happens automatically   


>   Line: 108
    pylint: consider-using-with / Consider using 'with' for resource-allocating operations (col 16)
    
>     for word in open(filename):

<br/><br/>

**● Import libraries on toplevel**
- For better practice in programming, we should use import at the toplevel means top of the code.


> Line: 156
>    pylint: import-outside-toplevel / Import outside toplevel (textwrap) (col 4)
>      Line: 210
>    pylint: import-outside-toplevel / Import outside toplevel (sys) (col 4)
    
>     import textwrap

<br/><br/><br/>

**● Using f-string methods**
- We could use % or the str.format method to format a string. Even though these methods are still valid, f-strings are more preferred.


> Line: 162<br/>
>    pylint: consider-using-f-string / Formatting a regular string which could be a f-string (col 15)<br/>
> Line: 196<br/>
>    pylint: consider-using-f-string / Formatting a regular string which could be a f-string (col 11)<br/>
> Line: 198<br/>
>    pylint: consider-using-f-string / Formatting a regular string which could be a f-string (col 11)<br/>
> Line: 199<br/>
>    pylint: consider-using-f-string / Formatting a regular string which could be a f-string (col 11)<br/>

<br/><br/>

**● Redefining already defined keywords**
- It could be considered as a bad practise to use the already defined keywords as a variable names.

>   Line: 171<br/>
>    pylint: redefined-builtin / Redefining built-in 'sum' (col 4)<br/>

>     sum = 0

<br/><br/>

**● Unused statement**

>   Line: 204<br/>
>   pylint: pointless-statement / Statement seems to have no effect (col 4)<br/>

>     print
